# Anti Shoulder Peeping iOS Mobile Application
iOS mobile application aimed at preventing people from physically peeping over one's shoulder in an attempt to steal sensitive information. The application uses the front facing camera alongside Apple's Vision Framework to detect when there is more than a single face in the front facing camera video capture. When the application detects more than a single face the app can perform one of two reactionary measures, exit the current application or dim and reset the screens brightness. Both the reactionary measures have been developed to reduce the amount of sensitive information that could be leaked and alert the user of the application that someone is looking over their shoulder.

## Frameworks Used
- Vision Framework
- ARKit
- Swift 5 (Language)
- XCode
